This Repository is meant to learn more about Sorting Algorithms.

Bubble Sort
Description: This sorting algorithm reads adjacent elements and compares the other elements and swapes them if they are not in the right order. This sorting algorithm is not good with large amount of data because it will take a long time to sort with the worst case senerio.
Worst Case: O(n^2)
Best Case: O(n)
Note: The current algorithm is not completely optimized because if the list is already sorted it will still try to read and sort the algorithm

Insertion Sort
Description: This sorting algorithm sorts a list by spliting the list by a unsorted and sorted lists. The Algorithm will grab an element from the unsorted list and "Insert" it to the sorted list and reads adjacent elements and compares the other element and swapes them if they are no in the right order.

Worst Case: O(n^2)

Best Case:O(n)
